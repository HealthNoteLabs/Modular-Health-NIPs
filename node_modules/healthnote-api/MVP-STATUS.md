# NIP-101h MCP Server - MVP Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. MCP Server Setup
- Successfully integrated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
- HTTP transport configured on port 4000
- Session management implemented
- Proper request/response handling

### 2. NIP-101h Data Loading
- Dynamic parsing of NIP-101h markdown file
- All 15 health metric kinds loaded (14 main + 2 caloric)
- Automatic categorization based on kind number ranges
- Fallback descriptions for metrics without specific documentation

### 3. MCP Tools Implemented

#### `getNip101hKindInfo`
- Returns detailed information about a specific NIP-101h kind
- Includes name, category, description, unit, and tags

#### `listNip101hKinds`
- Lists all available NIP-101h kinds
- Optional category filtering support

#### `prepareNip101hEvent`
- Prepares event structure for client-side encryption
- Adds all required NIP-101h tags
- Includes placeholder for NIP-44 encrypted content

#### `fetchUserNip101hEventsInstruction`
- Provides Nostr filter for fetching health events
- Includes relay recommendations
- Supports time-based and kind-based filtering

### 4. Documentation
- Comprehensive README with usage examples
- API documentation for all MCP tools
- Privacy considerations clearly stated

### 5. Deployment Ready
- Smithery configuration file created
- Dockerfile ready for containerization
- Environment variable support

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### 1. Unit Parsing
- Some metrics missing unit information from NIP files
- Manual fallbacks added for Age and Caloric data
- Parser successfully identifies unit tags but may need refinement

### 2. Description Parsing
- Generic fallback descriptions for most metrics
- Only Weight has its full description from NIP file
- Parser works but needs adjustment for section boundaries

## üöÄ Ready for Use

The MCP server is functional and ready for developers to:
1. Discover available NIP-101h health metrics
2. Get information about specific metrics
3. Prepare health events for publishing
4. Generate queries to fetch user health data

## üìã Next Steps (Post-MVP)

1. **Enhance Parser**: Improve unit and description extraction
2. **Add Validation**: Implement event validation against NIP-101h schema
3. **Caching**: Add caching for parsed NIP data
4. **Metrics**: Add usage metrics and monitoring
5. **Extended Tools**: Add more sophisticated query builders

## üéØ MVP Status: COMPLETE

The server provides all core functionality needed for developers to integrate NIP-101h health data into their applications. While there are improvements to be made, the current implementation meets all MVP requirements.
