## NIP-101h - Health Profile Framework

**Status:** Draft  
**Author:** TheWildHustle

## Abstract

This NIP defines a framework for storing and sharing health and fitness profile data on Nostr. It establishes a set of standardized event kinds for individual health metrics, allowing applications to selectively access specific health information while preserving user control and privacy.

In this framework exists
- NIP-101h.1 Weight using kind 1351 
- NIP-101h.2 Height using kind 1352 
- NIP-101h.3 Age using kind 1353 
- NIP-101h.4 Gender using kind 1354 
- NIP-101h.5 Fitness Level using kind 1355 


## Motivation

I want to build and support an ecosystem of health and fitness related nostr clients that have the ability to share and utilize a bunch of specific interoperable health metrics. 

- **Selective access** - Applications can access only the data they need
- **User control** - Users can choose which metrics to share
- **Interoperability** - Different health applications can share data
- **Privacy** - Sensitive health information can be managed independently

## Specification

### Kind Number Range

Health profile metrics use the kind number range 1351-1399:

| Kind      | Metric                             |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1351      | Weight                             |
| 1352      | Height                             |
| 1353      | Age                                |
| 1354      | Gender                             |
| 1355      | Fitness Level                      |
| 1356-1399 | Reserved for future health metrics |

### Common Structure

All health metric events SHOULD follow these guidelines:

- The content field contains the primary value of the metric
- Required tags:
  - `['t', 'health']` - For categorizing as health data
  - `['t', metric-specific-tag]` - For identifying the specific metric
  - `['unit', unit-of-measurement]` - When applicable
- Optional tags:
  - `['converted_value', value, unit]` - For providing alternative unit measurements
  - `['timestamp', ISO8601-date]` - When the metric was measured
  - `['source', application-name]` - The source of the measurement

### Unit Handling

Health metrics often have multiple ways to be measured. To ensure interoperability:

- Where multiple units are possible, one standard unit SHOULD be chosen as canonical
- When using non-standard units, a `converted_value` tag SHOULD be included with the canonical unit
- Both the original and converted values should be provided for maximum compatibility

### Client Implementation Guidelines

Clients implementing this NIP SHOULD:

- Allow users to explicitly choose which metrics to publish
- Support reading health metrics from other users when appropriate permissions exist
- Support updating metrics with new values over time
- Preserve tags they don't understand for future compatibility
- Support at least the canonical unit for each metric

### Extensions

New health metrics can be proposed as extensions to this NIP using the format:

- NIP-101h.X where X is the metric number

Each extension MUST specify:
- A unique kind number in the range 1351-1399
- The content format and meaning
- Required and optional tags
- Examples of valid events

## Privacy Considerations

Health data is sensitive personal information. Clients implementing this NIP SHOULD:

- Make it clear to users when health data is being published
- Consider incorporating NIP-44 encryption for sensitive metrics
- Allow users to selectively share metrics with specific individuals
- Provide easy ways to delete previously published health data

# NIP-101h.1: Weight

## Description
This NIP defines the format for storing and sharing weight data on Nostr.

## Event Kind: 1351

## Content
The content field MUST contain the numeric weight value as a string.

## Required Tags
- ['unit', 'kg' or 'lb'] - Unit of measurement
- ['t', 'health'] - Categorization tag
- ['t', 'weight'] - Specific metric tag

## Optional Tags
- ['converted_value', value, unit] - Provides the weight in alternative units for interoperability
- ['timestamp', ISO8601 date] - When the weight was measured

## Examples
```json
{
  "kind": 1351,
  "content": "70",
  "tags": [
    ["unit", "kg"],
    ["t", "health"],
    ["t", "weight"]
  ]
}
```

```json
{
  "kind": 1351,
  "content": "154",
  "tags": [
    ["unit", "lb"],
    ["t", "health"],
    ["t", "weight"],
    ["converted_value", "69.85", "kg"]
  ]
}
```



## NIP-101h.2: Height

**Status:** Draft

### Description

This NIP defines the format for storing and sharing height data on Nostr.

**Event Kind:** 1352

### Content

The content field can use two formats:
- For metric height: A string containing the numeric height value in centimeters (cm)
- For imperial height: A JSON string with feet and inches properties

### Required Tags

- `['t', 'health']` - Categorization tag
- `['t', 'height']` - Specific metric tag
- `['unit', 'cm' or 'imperial']` - Unit of measurement

### Optional Tags

- `['converted_value', value, 'cm']` - Provides height in centimeters for interoperability when imperial is used
- `['timestamp', ISO8601-date]` - When the height was measured

### Examples

```jsx
// Example 1: Metric height
Apply to App.jsx

// Example 2: Imperial height with conversion
Apply to App.jsx
```

### Implementation Notes

- Centimeters (cm) is the canonical unit for height interoperability
- When using imperial units, a conversion to centimeters SHOULD be provided
- Height values SHOULD be positive integers
- For maximum compatibility, clients SHOULD support both formats

## NIP-101h.3: Age

**Status:** Draft

### Description

This NIP defines the format for storing and sharing age data on Nostr.

**Event Kind:** 1353

### Content

The content field MUST contain the numeric age value as a string.

### Required Tags

- `['unit', 'years']` - Unit of measurement
- `['t', 'health']` - Categorization tag
- `['t', 'age']` - Specific metric tag

### Optional Tags

- `['timestamp', ISO8601-date]` - When the age was recorded
- `['dob', ISO8601-date]` - Date of birth (if the user chooses to share it)

### Examples

```jsx
// Example 1: Basic age
Apply to App.jsx

// Example 2: Age with DOB
Apply to App.jsx
```

### Implementation Notes

- Age SHOULD be represented as a positive integer
- For privacy reasons, date of birth (dob) is optional
- Clients SHOULD consider updating age automatically if date of birth is known
- Age can be a sensitive metric and clients may want to consider encrypting this data

- `['t', 'gender']` - Specific metric tag

### Optional Tags

- `['timestamp', ISO8601-date]` - When the gender was recorded
- `['preferred_pronouns', string]` - User's preferred pronouns

### Common Values

While any string value is permitted, the following common values are recommended for interoperability:
- male
- female
- non-binary
- other
- prefer-not-to-say

### Examples

```jsx
// Example 1: Basic gender
Apply to App.jsx

// Example 2: Gender with pronouns
Apply to App.jsx
```

### Implementation Notes

- Clients SHOULD allow free-form input for gender
- For maximum compatibility, clients SHOULD support the common values
- Gender is a sensitive personal attribute and clients SHOULD consider appropriate privacy controls

- `['t', 'fitness']` - Fitness category tag
- `['t', 'level']` - Specific metric tag

### Optional Tags

- `['timestamp', ISO8601-date]` - When the fitness level was recorded
- `['activity', activity-type]` - Specific activity the fitness level relates to
- `['metrics', JSON-string]` - Quantifiable fitness metrics used to determine level

### Common Values

While any string value is permitted, the following common values are recommended for interoperability:
- beginner
- intermediate
- advanced
- elite
- professional

### Examples

```jsx
// Example 1: Basic fitness level
Apply to App.jsx

// Example 2: Activity-specific fitness level with metrics
Apply to App.jsx
```

### Implementation Notes

- Fitness level is subjective and may vary by activity
- The activity tag can be used to specify fitness level for different activities
- The metrics tag can provide objective measurements to support the fitness level
- Clients can extend this format to include activity-specific fitness assessments
- For general fitness apps, the simple beginner/intermediate/advanced scale is recommended
